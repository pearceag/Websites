        I am confident when I say this, I am not a master web developer. I have little experience with html and css.
        That being said I have a lot to learn :). Kind of unrelated to html, this week I learned how to use LiveShare
        is Visual Studio Code. That is such a great extension! I also have never used Putty so I learned how to generate
        a public key on Putty and use it as ssh access to my DigitalOcean Droplet.

        Related to html, I got a refresher on the basics of html. For example, how every html file needs to have <!DOCTYPE html>
        and <hml></hml> tags. Something new I learned about were the marquee tag (which I though was really cool), implementing
        all the different form elements.
