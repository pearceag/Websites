            I am confident when I say this, I am not a master web developer. I have little experience with html and css.
            That being said I have a lot to learn :). Kind of unrelated to html, this week I learned how to use
            LiveShare
            in Visual Studio Code. That is such a great extension! I also have never used Putty so I learned how to
            generate
            a public key on Putty and use it as ssh access to my DigitalOcean Droplet.

            Related to html, I got a refresher on the basics of html. For example, how every html file needs to have
            and an html and body tags. Something new I learned about were the marquee tag (which I though was really cool),
            implementing
            all the different Form elements. In Lab2, my partner and I implemented a label where the user can indicate 
            his/her favorite color <a href="task3.html">here</a>
            along with adding other labels and divs for users to type in answers to our questions.
