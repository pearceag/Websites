            <ol>
                <li>
                    The theme of my website is a place to book either a flight to the moon or a trip orbiting the Earth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From my knowledge, I don't think there is a website that serves this purpose yet and all my images are From
                    pexels.com.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My five paragraphs are under the Prepare for Flight page and my <code>index.html</code> file is my home page of
                    the website.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each page has its own header.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have a navigation bar at the top of my page for going back to the home page or to login/signup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am using a media query to shrink the size of the contact information at the bottom of the screen when
                    the window is smaller. Everything else adjusts well with smaller screens.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All my pages on my site have a shared external stylesheet <code>nav-bar.css</code> that keeps the coherent style 
                    accross all the pages. I have also make a couple of other style sheets for page specific styling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All my images have an <code>alt</code> attribute describing what the image is or what it is being used for.
                </li>
                <li>
                    IDK
                </li>
                <li>
                    All my images are placed in a directory called <code>images</code> and all my stylesheets are in a directory called 
                    <code>css</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am not using any third-party tools to build my website.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I believe all my style sheets validate without any warnings or errors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My content on the home page has center alignment while pages like <code>login</code> and <code>signup</code> have
                    left alignment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    None of my text bleeds against the edges and the content is adequate and consistent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My website has two font faces: headings being sans-serif font and paragraphs being serif font.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My site has two forms: the login and signup pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My site contains a link at the footer of each page to nasa.com for more information about space.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My classes have meaning ful names and are organized and readable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My site is stored in my git repo linked<a href="https://github.com/pearceag/cs347.git"> here</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All files are named completely lowercase.
                </li>

                    My git has a steady flow up commits and pushes.
