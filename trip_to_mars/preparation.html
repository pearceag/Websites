        <h2>FAQ's</h2>

        <h3>What should I wear in flight?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Temperatures may be cold on your flight so we recommend you wear multiple layers of warm
                clothing. Avoid wearing bulkey, thick items of clothing. You should wear a lightweight
                long-sleeved shirt. Layer 2 should be a thin fleece jacket or vest. For your 3rd layer,
                we recommend either a lightweight insulated jacket or a windbreaker. We also recommend
                wearing pants, NOT SHORTS! When in space, we want to void any skin being exposed to the
                space radiation and the cold temperatures. Also, be sure to wear closed toed shoes with
                multiple layers of socks. Bring gloves as well.

            <li> Yes, some space gear will be provided. You will be provided a spacesuit, helmet, and
                camera for your trip. We still recommend you wear layers of clothing under your spacesuit
                due to freezing temperatures. Extra items are availble for purchase but there will be
                an additional charge.
