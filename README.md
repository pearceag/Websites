# Websites

This is a compilation of 3 websites I created.

1) blogs - On a weekly basis, I documented my exploration of fresh web development techniques involving HTML and/or CSS. Each entry featured a paragraph detailing my learning process, followed by a practical demonstration of the technique on the same page.
2) trip_to_mars - The website presented a simulated trip planning experience to Mars, comprising various tabs. Among them, there was a gallery displaying captivating images from space. Another tab allowed users to sign up for the trip, while a separate section facilitated the booking of flights to Mars. Additionally, there was a suggestions page offering practical recommendations for packing and preparing for the journey. (https://project1.lexiepearce.me:8443/ --> no longer active)
3) music_playlist - this website functions and operates like a playlist, storing relevant information. This application utilizes MySQL, employing one table named "playlist-table". To interact with the database, the app offers an Express-based web service. The data is exchanged in JSON format via my web service. Cross-origin resource sharing is supported using custom middleware and an "options" wildcard endpoint. (https://project2.lexiepearce.me:8443/ --> no longer active)
