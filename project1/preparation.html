        <h2>FAQ's</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <lh><h3>What should I wear in flight?</h3></lh>
                <li>Temperatures may be cold on your flight so we recommend you wear multiple layers of warm 
                    clothing. Avoid wearing bulkey, thick items of clothing. You should wear a lightweight 
                    long-sleeved shirt. Layer 2 should be a thin fleece jacket or vest. For your 3rd layer, 
                    we recommend either a lightweight insulated jacket or a windbreaker. We also recommend
                    wearing pants, NOT SHORTS! When in space, we want to void any skin being exposed to the
                    space radiation and the cold temperatures. Also, be sure to wear closed toed shoes with
                    multiple layers of socks. Bring gloves as well.

                <lh><h3>Will space gear be provided?</h3></lh>
                <li> Yes, some space gear will be provided. You will be provided a spacesuit, helmet, and
                    camera for your trip. We still recomment you wear layers of clothing under your spacesuit
                    due to freezing temperatures.
