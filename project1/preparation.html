            Be sure to bring your ID and boarding pass and have it out and ready for the TSA official.

            <ul>
                <lh><h3>What should I wear in flight?</h3></lh>
                <li>Temperatures may be cold on your flight so we recommend you wear multiple layers of warm 
                    clothing. Avoid wearing bulkey, thick items of clothing. You should wear a lightweight 
                    long-sleeved shirt. Layer 2 should be a thin fleece jacket or vest. For your 3rd layer, 
                    we recommend either a lightweight insulated jacket or a windbreaker. We also recommend
                    wearing pants, NOT SHORTS! When in space, we want to void any skin being exposed to the
                    space radiation and the cold temperatures. Also, be sure to wear closed toed shoes with
                    multiple layers of socks. Bring gloves as well.

                <lh><h3>Will space gear be provided?</h3></lh>
                <li> Yes, some space gear will be provided. You will be provided a spacesuit, helmet, and
                    camera for your trip. We still recommend you wear layers of clothing under your spacesuit
                    due to freezing temperatures. Extra items are availble for purchase but there will be
                    an additional charge.
                </li>

                <lh><h3>What side effects are expected during flight?</h3></lh>
                <li>You will experience weightlessness from zero gravity. All feelings a nausea and vomiting,
                    headaches, lethargy, and vertigo are normal and expected while experiencing weightlessness.
                    Passengers must undergo a health examination before flying. All passengers that pass this
                    health examination will be fine on flight. This examination is for all passengers to ensure
                    a safe travel experience for all on board.
