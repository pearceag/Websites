        <p>This week I am learning/getting more familiar with React. We did two labs that are going to be helpful for out 
            project 3 implementations. You can see my implementation of this lab <a href="https://dukebox.lexiepearce.me/">here</a>!
            I learned how to deploy a react project to my DigitalOcean droplet. Also, I learned how the <code>store.js</code> file and
            <code>actions.js</code> file work together through the <code>reducer</code> function. I am starting to fully understand how
            all these different classes work together to creat a React Application which is super exciting since last week I was pretty 
            lost on how everything worked together.

            This week outside of class I learned about the video tag in html. This tag allows you to embed a video in your website. This
            a very helpful tool for websites where you want to show your user a tutorial or something cool through a video. You can specify
            certain attributes (width, height, autoplay, loop, controls, etc.). Below is the code and implementation of this tag.
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code>
    &ltvideo autoplay="" loop="" controls="" width="640" height="480"&gt
    &ltsource type="video/mp4" src="https://endtest-videos.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/documentation/endtest_data_driven_testing_csv.mp4"&gt
    &lt/video&gt
            </code>
        </pre>

        <center><video autoplay="" loop="" controls="" width="640" height="480">
            <source type="video/mp4" src="https://endtest-videos.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/documentation/endtest_data_driven_testing_csv.mp4">
        </video></center>
