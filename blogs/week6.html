            I'm back!! Last week we had Project 1 due so we didn't have time to write a weekly blog as well.
            This week though was exciting! We upgraded to javascript. I really loved the second lab we had
            this week when we wrote out own shell using Node.js. I didn't fully complete the lab, but I
            implemented the <code>exit</code> and <code>pwd</code> commands. In this lab, I also learned
            how to convert a callback scheme into a promise scheme. I created a promise constructor <code>ask()</code>
            that expected the <code>readline.question</code> function as its parameter. Then, it hands that function 
            another function, <code>resolve</code> which is called when my asynchronous operation finishes. You can see
            this implemented below:

            <code><pre>
    const fsPromises = require('fs').promises;
    const path = require('path');
    const http = require('http');

    const readline = require('readline').createInterface({
        input: process.stdin,
        output: process.stdout
    });

    
    function ask() {
        return new Promise(resolve => {
            readline.question('> ', answer => resolve(answer));
        });
    }

    async function main() {
    while (true) {
        const response = await ask();
        switch(response) {
            case('exit'):
                console.log('Exiting...');
                process.exit();
                break;
            case('pwd'):
                console.log(process.cwd());
                break;
            default:
                break;
        }
    }
            </pre></code>
        </p>
            Outside of class, I learned how to make an image pop-up when a user hovers over it. What I did was set three images side by side using
            an unordered list. I put the unordered list in a flexbox. 
            <code><pre>
        ul {
            display: flex;
            }
        
            li {
            list-style-type: none;
            padding: 10px;
            position: relative;
            }
            </pre></code>
            
            To visually hig the larger image, I used absolute positioning and put the larger
            images in a <code>span</code>. This should make it so that only the smaller images are left.

            <code>
                <pre>
            .large {
                position: absolute;
                left: -9999px;
                }
                </pre>
            </code>

            Next, I added some styles to make the larger image actually pop-up and look like it is hovering
            over the smaller images.

            <code>
                <pre>
            li:hover .large {
                left: 20px;
                top: -150px;
                }

                .large-image {
                    border-radius: 4px;
                     box-shadow: 1px 1px 3px 3px rgba(127, 127, 127, 0.15);;
                  }
                </pre>
            </code>
