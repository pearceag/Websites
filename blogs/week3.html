            Flexboxes are so cool!! Week 3 was all about flexboxes. The labs with week
            were very challenging to me, but the product of the labs are so worth it.
            What was most challenging for me was in when we needed to create multiple
            containers and figuring out how to navigate a child in one container
            differently then a child in the other container. This is <a href="task1.html">Task 1</a>
            from Lab 7. Task 1 Lab 7 is what I am most proud of from this week. I really liked
            the way <code>flex-wrap</code> and <code>flex-grow</code> worked to make the images on 
            the screen wrap as you changed the size of the screen.

            What I learned this week is outside of class is how to add a Title Tooltip to your HTML page!
            This Title Tooltip is so useful for showing extra information about a clearly selected element.
            <b><span title="You're a wizard Harry!!! :)">If you hover over this sentence you will
                see the a nice message and Title Tooltip in action!!</span></b> Below is the snippet of code 
                I used to implement this feature.
        </p>

        <p>
            <code><pre>&ltspan&gt title="You're a wizard Harry!!! :)">If you hover over this sentence you will see the a nice message and Title Tooltip in action!!&lt/span&gt</pre></code>
        </p>

        <p>
            Since the Title Tooltip was so easy to implement I also looked up how to make text scroll in CSS. Scrolling text can be very useful on websites to catch the eye of users
            and great for advertising on websites. What's cool about this feature is you can make it scroll from right to left,
            left to right, up to down, or down to up. You can determine the direction of the scrolling by modifying the <code>transform translateX</code> to scroll horizontally on the x-axis and 
            <code>transform translateY</code> to scroll vertically on the y-axis. To make the text scroll from left to right you pass in a positive percentage in as the parameter for <code>translateX</code>
            and a negative percentage value to scroll from right to left. Likewise, to make text scroll down to up, you would pass a positive percentage in as the parameter for 
            <code>translateY</code> and a negative percentage to scroll from up to down. Below is my implementation of the scroll animation in CSS. Do you recognize the sentence being scrolled?
            If not it's the first sentence <a href="https://eg4.nic.in/jnv/DFILES/EBOOKS/IR/Harry-potter-sorcerers-stone.pdf"><u>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</u></a> (I am a <b>HUGE</b> Harry Potter Fan :).

            <div id="scroll">
                <div id="text">"The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive.”</div>
            </div>

            <h3>Below, is the HTML and CSS code for the feature above.</h3>

            <code><pre>
&ltdiv id="scroll"&gt
    &ltdiv id="The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive.”&lt/div&gt
&lt/div&gt
            </pre></code>

            <code><pre>
#container {
    border: 3px solid black;
    border-radius: 5px;
    overflow: hidden;
}

#text {
    transform: translateX(100%);
    
    animation: scroll-animation 30s linear infinite;
    }
    
    @keyframes scroll-animation {
    from {
        transform: translateX(100%);
    }
    to {
        transform: translateX(-100%);
    }
            </pre></code>
