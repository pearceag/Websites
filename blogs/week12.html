        <p>This week in class I learned about Remote States and Multi-page Applications. I learned about another part of Redux which
            is called the thunk creator. This is similar to an action creator, but instead it is a block of unevaluated code that gets
            passed around in a system. I also learned how to <code>fetch</code> information from a web service. I attempted to do this
            in the githubber lab. I'm still trying to get the <code>fetch</code> call to work. I found it interesting we put the fetching
            code in an <code>actions.js</code> file since that's where we should put thunk creators since thunks are dispatched like actions
            and they themselves dispatch actions. I also attempted to implement the QuizBuzz example from the textbook. I am an little 
            unfamiliar with out the Multi-Page Application section of the textbook works all together. I'm sure after a lab and I get the 
            QuizBuzz implementation working I will get a better understanding. I'm excited to apply these implementations to my Project 3.

            Outside of class I learned how to create the Typewriter Effect in CSS. It's a very inventive and clever way to animate typing
            and adds a bit of life to a webpage. Below is my implementation of the typewriter effect:
        </p>
        <div class="typewriter">
            <h3>Hello CS347! This is Lexie's Blog :)</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
            Below is the CSS code for this implementation:
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code>             
  /* DEMO-SPECIFIC STYLES */
  .typewriter h3 {
    color: #fff;
    font-family: monospace;
    overflow: hidden; /* Ensures the content is not revealed until the animation */
    border-right: .15em solid orange; /* The typwriter cursor */
    white-space: nowrap; /* Keeps the content on a single line */
    margin: 0 auto; /* Gives that scrolling effect as the typing happens */
    letter-spacing: .15em; /* Adjust as needed */
    animation: 
      typing 3.5s steps(30, end),
      blink-caret .5s step-end infinite;
  }
  
  /* The typing effect */
  @keyframes typing {
    from { width: 0 }
    to { width: 100% }
  }
  
  /* The typewriter cursor effect */
  @keyframes blink-caret {
    from, to { border-color: transparent }
    50% { border-color: orange }
  }
            </code>
        </pre>
    </main>
