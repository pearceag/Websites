            This week was mainly focused on CSS. I learned about Fixed, Relative,
            and Absolute positioning. With Relative positioning, the element is anchored
            against its own static box. In Fixed positioning, the element is anchored against
            the browser's viewport. And with Absolute positioning the element is anchored
            against one of its ancestor elements. It took me a all week to grasp the concept
            of anchoring and the differences between the positioning. I think I finally
            understand though. In lab 9 I was having issues with the getting the margin
            notes to be in absolute positioning to the paragraph. I initially forgot to
            assign a positioning for the margin note's ancestor element (the paragraph element),
            but once I realized the paragraph needed to have a relative positioning, everything
            worked out. YAY!
        </p>

        <p>
            I also learned about Media Queries. These are cool because I understand them to be like
            conditionals (if/then statements), but in CSS. For example for lab 9, I used a media query
            to move the margin notes to go underneath the paragraph element whent he width of the screen
            800px or below. Below is the line of code to impelemnt this "conditional":
            <code><pre>@media (max-width: 800px) </pre></code>
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of class I learned how to make a navigation bar which I have implemented here and
            in my Project 1. Not only does this navigation bar allow you to navigate to other web pages,
            it changes color when the mouse hovers over one of the nagivation bar elements and the page
            that you are actively on is a different color. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Here is the HTML code for the navigation bar:
            <code><pre>
                &ltdiv class="topnav"&gt
                        &lta href="index.html"&gtHome&lt/a&gt
                        &lta href="week1.html"&gtWeek 1&lt/a&gt
                        &lta href="week2.html"&gtWeek 2&lt/a&gt
                        &lta href="week3.html"&gtWeek 3&lt/a&gt
                        &lta class="active" href="week4.html"&gtWeek 4&lt/a&gt
                &lt/div&gt
            </pre></code>

            And here is the CSS code for the navigation bar:
            <code>
                <pre>
                    /* Add a pinkish background color to the top navigation */
                    .topnav {
                        background-color: #C38D9E;
                        overflow: hidden;
                    }
                    
                    /* Style the links inside the navigation bar */
                    .topnav a {
                        float: left;
                        color: #f2f2f2;
                        text-align: center;
                        padding: 14px 16px;
                        text-decoration: none;
                        font-size: 17px;
                    }
                    
                    /* Change the color of links on hover */
                    .topnav a:hover {
                        background-color: #ddd;
                        color: black;
                    }
                    
                    /* Add a color to the active/current link */
                    .topnav a.active {
                        background-color: #E8A87C;
                        color: white;
                    }
                </pre>
            </code>
