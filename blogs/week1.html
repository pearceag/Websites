            I am confident when I say this, I am not a master web developer. I have little experience with html and css.
            That being said I have a lot to learn :). Kind of unrelated to html, this week I learned how to use
            LiveShare
            in Visual Studio Code. That is such a great extension! I also have never used Putty so I learned how to
            generate
            a public key on Putty and use it as ssh access to my DigitalOcean Droplet.

            Related to html, I got a refresher on the basics of html. For example, how every html file needs to have
            and a html and body tags. Something new I learned about were the marquee tag (which I thought was really
            cool),
            implementing
            all the different Form elements. In Lab2, my partner and I implemented a label where the user can indicate
            his/her favorite color along with adding other labels and divs for users to type in answers to our
            questions.

            This week I looked up an article on how to rotate text in css. The rotate()
            function rotates text either the clockwise or counter clockwise direction.
            Css has multiple functions making you able to either rotate over the x-axis with the rotateX() function,
            rotate over the y-axis with the rotateY() function,
            and rotate over the z-axis with the rotateZ(). All these functions take an angle as a parameter. Not only
            does this function rotate text, it can rotate HTML elements as well, <b>as seen below</b>. Can you guess what it
            says? The link referenced is <a href="https://www.educba.com/css-rotate-text/">here</a>.
