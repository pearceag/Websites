        <p> Wow it's the last blog post! I can't believe this semester is coming to an end. Even though
            at times I was very frustrated, in general, I enjoyed this class very much and I am leaving
            this course knowing more then I did on the first day of class which is a good sign! I really
            think the design of the course was pretty good. I learned a lot from the labs and struggling
            them. I would maybe in the beginning of each class have a little lecture (5-10 min) about the
            key/important aspects from the assigned readings. I know we did a little bit of that towards
            the second half of the semester, but I think it would've been helpful for me if we little
            example problems together in class before the labs. What helped me learn the material in the course
            was doing the labs and the pas. Although, I got frustrated with the labs, towards the end of the 
            semester, they significantly helped me for the final project. What also helped me learn the materials
            of this course was collaboratively working with other students on the labs and going to Office Hours.
            I at first was annoyed that our Projects weren't partner projects and Stewart's students had partners
            for the projects, but I think having no partner for the projects helped me learn the material better.
            Because I didn't have a partner for the projects, I exactly what's going on in my code and I can design
            it the way I want to. It's a full reflection of who I am. For me, it was a big learning curve from learning
            html/css to js/React. I think that maybe we should split these subjects into two courses possibly - having
            the html/css course be a prerequisite for the js/React course. This way we can go into more depth and learn
            more complicated functions in html, css, js, and React and build more complicated/useful projects. Also,
            although I didn't mind the blog posts each week, I know many students that missed several blog posts, so maybe
            in the future offer up weekly blog posts as an incentive for extra credit.
