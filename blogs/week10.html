            <p>Wow it's been a while! I've learned a bunch these past few weeks. To start off, in project 2
                implemented a webservice which allows a useer to create a playlist. I learned how to use 
                a Node.js web application framework, express to support CRUD operations. I also got my feetwet
                with mySQL to create a realtional database. This week in class, we are learning front-end frameworks
                such as REACT. For <a href="https://replit.com/@Pokemaniac00/Lab18#src/App.jsx">lab 16</a> we created
                the Acrostic game. It doesn't work fully, but you are able to look at the code that we have if you wish.
            </p>

            <p>This week outside of class, I looked into how to create Dark Mode on a page by pressing a button. I used 
                both Javascript and CSS to complete this task. Below is the code for the Javascript that triggers dark-mode
                when pressed:
                <code>
                    <pre>
function myFunction() {
    var element = document.body;
    element.classList.toggle("dark-mode");
}
                    </pre>
                </code>
                Then in my CSS file I had to define what dark-mode looked like. I needed to change the background color to a 
                darker color and change the text to white. See the code below:
                <code>
                    <pre>
.dark-mode {
    background-color: #292929;
    color: white;
    }
                    </pre>
                </code>
            </p>

            <button onclick="myFunction()">Toggle dark mode</button>
            <script>
                function myFunction() {
                    var element = document.body;
                    element.classList.toggle("dark-mode");
                }
            </script>
        </body>
